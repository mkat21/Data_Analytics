#average_passengers_per_car = ca r _pool _capaci t y / passenger
#NameError : name ’ ca r _pool _capaci t y ’ i s not defined

#NameError stating that the name 'car_pool_capacity' is not defined. In the given code, the error occurs on line 8, where there is an attempt to calculate the average number of passengers per car using the variable 'car_pool_capacity', which has not been defined previously in the code.
#This error occurs because the variable 'car_pool_capacity' is referenced before it is assigned a value. In order to fix this error, you need to define and assign a value to the 'car_pool_capacity' variable before using it in the calculation

#q2
'''If you change space_in_a_car to 4, the code will still function correctly because the subsequent calculations involving space_in_a_car only involve multiplication with other integers (cars_driven). In this case, the result of the calculation will be an integer.'''
